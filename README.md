# Tryout

In this repository I collect descriptions and basic examples on how to setup different new **things and tools I try out**.
That's mainly for my own reference, but maybe this helps someone else too.
Please leave a star if you find this useful, get in contact with me, or file an issue if there is something wrong or missing - and I'm pretty sure it is.
