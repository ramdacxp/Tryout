# Tryout

In this repository I collect descriptions and basic examples on how to setup different new **things and tools I try out**.
That's mainly for my own reference, but maybe this helps someone else too.
Please [leave a star](https://github.com/ramdacxp/Tryout/stargazers) if you find this useful, get in contact with [me](https://github.com/ramdacxp), or [file an issue](https://github.com/ramdacxp/Tryout/issues/new) if there is something wrong or missing - and I'm pretty sure it is.
